# My new mini ITX PC.

### The FormD T1 Case

I don't think it's uncommon for ITX builds to be built around a specific case. I went with the FormD T1 V2, at just 9.95L in volume, it's about as small as you can go without having a significant impact on performance.

The unique thing about this case is that it ships as a flatpack, so you have to assemble it yourself, whilst this makes the build process more time consuming, it gives you more ways to configure it. I went with a sandwich layout.
